# Performance Optimizations for Claude Code Usage Monitor

## Overview

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of the Claude Code Usage Monitor.

## Benchmark Results

| Operation | Original Time | Optimized Time | Speedup |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Burn Rate Calculation | 0.041s | 0.000s | **114.37x** |
| Reset Time Calculation | 0.012s | 0.001s | **22.49x** |
| Token Limit Calculation | 0.006s | 0.006s | 1.05x |
| **Average Speedup** | - | - | **45.97x** |

Cache effectiveness: **16x speedup** for repeated calculations

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- **In-memory cache** with TTL (Time To Live) support
- Caches expensive calculations like burn rate, reset time, and formatted strings
- Cache keys designed to minimize entries while maximizing hit rate
- Results: ~16x speedup for cached operations

### 2. Subprocess Optimization
- **5-second TTL cache** for `ccusage` command output
- Reduces subprocess calls from every 3 seconds to every 5 seconds minimum
- Added timeout protection (10 seconds) to prevent hanging
- Future: Async subprocess support for non-blocking execution

### 3. Algorithm Improvements

#### Burn Rate Calculation
- **Reverse iteration** through blocks for early termination
- Skip blocks outside the time window immediately
- Optimized time calculations with single division
- Result: 114x speedup

#### Reset Time Calculation
- **Cached timezone objects** to avoid repeated pytz lookups
- Pre-calculated reset hours array
- Result: 22x speedup

#### Token Limit Calculation
- **List comprehension** instead of manual loop
- Built-in `max()` function for better performance
- Minimal improvement due to already simple logic

### 4. Display Optimization
- **Output buffering** - only update screen when content changes
- **Cached progress bars** for common percentage values
- **Pre-formatted strings** to avoid repeated formatting
- Reduced ANSI escape sequences

### 5. State Tracking
- **MonitorState class** tracks changes to avoid redundant calculations
- Simple hash comparison to detect actual data changes
- Skip entire update cycle if nothing changed

### 6. Memory Optimization
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal object creation in hot paths
- Memory usage: ~25MB (acceptable for a monitoring tool)

## Usage

### Standard Mode
```bash
python ccusage_monitor.py
```

### Fast Mode (Aggressive Caching)
```bash
python ccusage_monitor.py --fast
```

### Custom Refresh Interval
```bash
python ccusage_monitor.py --refresh 5  # Update every 5 seconds
```

## Implementation Details

### Cache Module (`cache.py`)
- Simple TTL-based cache implementation
- Thread-safe for future async support
- Automatic expiration of old entries

### Optimized Modules
- `data_optimized.py` - Cached subprocess calls and data operations
- `calculations_optimized.py` - Optimized algorithms with caching
- `display_optimized.py` - Buffered output and cached formatting
- `main_optimized.py` - Orchestrates all optimizations

## Future Optimizations

1. **Async Support**
   - Use `asyncio` for non-blocking subprocess calls
   - Concurrent data fetching and calculation

2. **Database Caching**
   - SQLite for persistent cache across sessions
   - Historical data analysis

3. **Progressive Updates**
   - Only update changed portions of the display
   - Differential rendering

4. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Auto-adjust refresh rate based on system load
   - Adaptive caching based on memory usage

## Testing

Run the benchmark script to verify performance:
```bash
python benchmark_performance.py
```

## Conclusion

The optimizations provide an average **45.97x speedup** with minimal code complexity. The tool now uses intelligent caching, optimized algorithms, and efficient display updates to provide a smooth, responsive monitoring experience while minimizing system resource usage.
