## Usage

### Standard Mode
```bash
ccusage-monitor
```

### Performance Mode (with monitoring)
```bash
ccusage-monitor --performance
```

### Rich UI Mode (enhanced visuals)
```bash
ccusage-monitor --rich
```

### Performance Monitoring Tool
```bash
# Run 30-second performance test
python performance_monitor.py --test 30

# Benchmark specific operations
python performance_monitor.py --benchmark burn_rate --iterations 1000

# Save results to file
python performance_monitor.py --test 60 --output results.json
```

### Custom Refresh Interval
```bash
python ccusage_monitor.py --refresh 5  # Update every 5 seconds
```

## Implementation Details

### Cache Module (`cache.py`)
- Simple TTL-based cache implementation
- Thread-safe for future async support
- Automatic expiration of old entries

### Optimized Modules
- `data_optimized.py` - Cached subprocess calls and data operations
- `calculations_optimized.py` - Optimized algorithms with caching
- `display_optimized.py` - Buffered output and cached formatting
- `main_optimized.py` - Orchestrates all optimizations

## Future Optimizations

1. **Async Support**
   - Use `asyncio` for non-blocking subprocess calls
   - Concurrent data fetching and calculation

2. **Database Caching**
   - SQLite for persistent cache across sessions
   - Historical data analysis

3. **Progressive Updates**
   - Only update changed portions of the display
   - Differential rendering

4. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Auto-adjust refresh rate based on system load
   - Adaptive caching based on memory usage

## Testing
